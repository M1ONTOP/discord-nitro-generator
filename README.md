> This is a completely open source discord nitro generator coded in batch, it is not guarenteed to generate you 100% free working nitro gifts however it does do as intended.
>
> I have also included a nitro checker which checks a list of nitro codes inside of the "codes.txt" file and outputs only working codes into a new .txt file named "working.txt", this is all done in the same directory the checker is placed in so it is recommended to run it in its own folder.

> Do note you will need to have python install and run "pip install requests" and "pip install colorama" into your command prompt if you are missing packages for the checker as it is in python and uses external libraries.
